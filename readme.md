I will reply and close issues on this repository after the exam is done, thank you for the comments and suggestions.

# Computational Intelligence

The course introduces various computational methods and data processing that can be labeled "artificial intelligence".

In more details students will:

- gain expertise on top-down and bottom-up methods where solutions are searched or built through trial-and-error
- acquire knowledge on approximate optimization techniques and exploit the relationship between optimization and learning
- understand the concepts of path-, local-, and policy-search
- learn how to tackle problems involving highly-structured, uncertain (possible), and imprecise (fuzzy) information

The course also encompasses general multi-agent systems and a range of algorithms inspired by natural systems, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and swarm optimization. The lectures will cover theoretical foundations, algorithm design, implementation, and applications to real-world problems.

**Introduction**

- What is "Computational Intelligence"? (included: what is "Artificial Intelligence"? Weak AI vs. Strong AI; the Turing Test; ...)
- Symbolic vs. Sub-symbolic intelligence
- Solving problems by searching; trial n'error vs. learning vs. evolution
