    "The Python code in the lib defines an abstract class `AbstractProblem` and a function `make_problem(a)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AbstractProblem` class has the following methods and properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`: Initializes the instance variable `_calls` to 0.\n",
    "- `x`: An abstract property. Subclasses of `AbstractProblem` are expected to implement this.\n",
    "- `calls`: A property that returns the number of times the instance has been called.\n",
    "- `onemax`: A static method that takes a genome (a sequence of genes) and returns the sum of its genes, treating each gene as a boolean value.\n",
    "- `__call__`: A special method that allows instances of the class to be called like functions. It increments `_calls`, computes fitnesses of the genome by slicing it into segments of length `x` and applying `onemax` to each segment, and then computes a value based on these fitnesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `make_problem(a)` function defines a subclass of `AbstractProblem` with `x` implemented as a property that always returns `a`, and returns this subclass. This allows you to create problems with different values of `x` easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this code provides a framework for defining and working with optimization problems where the goal is to maximize the sum of genes in a genome, with some penalty for non-maximal segments. The `x` property determines the segment length for this computation. The `calls` property allows you to track how many times a problem instance has been called. The `make_problem(a)` function makes it easy to create problem instances with different segment lengths."
