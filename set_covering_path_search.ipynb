    "# Set Covering\n",
    "\n",
    "Set covering problems are a class of combinatorial optimization problems in which the goal is to find a minimum-size collection of sets (subsets of a larger set) such that every element from the universal set is covered by at least one of the selected sets. These problems have applications in various fields, including operations research, computer science, logistics, and facility location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more formal definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a universal set U and a collection of subsets S = {S1, S2, ..., Sn}, where each Si is a subset of U, the set covering problem aims to find a minimum-size subset C of S such that the union of all sets in C covers every element in U. Mathematically, you want to minimize the cardinality of C, subject to the constraint that the union of sets in C equals U.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set covering problems can be described as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. The decision version of the problem is typically referred to as the Set Covering Problem (SCP), and it can be formulated as follows:\n",

    "**Decision Set Covering Problem (SCP):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: A finite set U, a collection of subsets S = {S1, S2, ..., Sn} of U, and a positive integer k.\n",
    "- Question: Is there a subset C of S with at most k sets such that the union of sets in C covers all elements of U?\n",
